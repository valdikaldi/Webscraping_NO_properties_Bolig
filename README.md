# Webscraping_NO_properties_Bolig



## <img src="markdown_icons/info_icon.svg" alt="Info Icon" width="50" height="25"> Description : 
In this project, I web scrape the website "www.hemnet.se", Swedens biggest property platform. I will gather historical transaction data on properties and their characteristics. 

In order to over come few challenges I utilize the well known and powerful Selenium library to construct by bot.  

Objective: Collect as much data on Swedish properties as possible - in a controlled and respectful manner without overloading their servers (Even though that is unlikely to happen.)
